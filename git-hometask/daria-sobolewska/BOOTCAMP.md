## My favourite book

It is hard to choose, but for sure one of my favourite books is **_Catch-22_ by Joseph Heller**. It makes you laugh at the begening, but with each page you read you realize that all situations described in this satirical novel are terryfing and not funny at all, so at the end it leaves you with mind full of thoughts and doubts.
