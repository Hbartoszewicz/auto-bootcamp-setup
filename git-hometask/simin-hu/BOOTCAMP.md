# My favorite movie

"Spirited away" directed by Hayao Miyazaki
This movie is full of philosophy. I watch it again and agian since I was a kid and it always inspires me in a different way. The soundtrack is also amazing. 

# skills after completion of the bootcamp

The bootcamp gives me an opportunity to know about the basic and advanced knowledge about automation testing. As a current manual tester my knowledge about testing is still limited. But the bootcamp teaches me more about SDLC and STLC. It also motivates me to dig into the programming. I hope the experience from here would also help me to get my feet in the door in the field.
