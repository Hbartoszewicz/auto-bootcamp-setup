# EVO BOOTCAMP TASK 1 (GIT PRACTICE)

## Name, Surname: 

Bogdans Pavlovs

## My Favourite Something: 

Frankly, I find it somewhat difficult to pinpoint a favourite with the amount of media we have access to nowadays.  
Even if I tried **really** hard, I would 100% end up with multiple favourites for each categorie, so instead, I'll just pick the first one that comes to mind.  

- **Album:** *"Revolutions per Minute"* by Rise Against  

    Peak punk, these guys have been with me ever since I was a teen and I find it hard to imagine not being able to just pop one of their songs and let it take my mind of something.  
    As for the album, *"Revolutions per Minute"* houses the song that initially drew me into liking the band so much.  
    If you are in the market for a new **(old)** punk band to discover, be sure to give those a listen:

    - ***"Black Masks & Gasoline" 2003***
    - ***"Heaven Knows" 2003***
    - ***"Halfway There" 2003***
    - ***"Voices Off Camera" 2003***
    - ***"Hero of War" 2008***
    - ***"Savior" 2008***
    - ***"People Live Here" 2014***

- **Movie:** *"In Bruges"* 2008

    I am a sucker for any movie starring **Ryan Gosling** or **Colin Farell**, and while this one only happens to have one of them, it puts Colin and the rest of the cast in a perfect setting, a purgatory-like, Belgium city of Bruges. It is, and I quote,  

    > a black comedy-drama crime thriller  

    If that is not enough to convince you it is a must watch, I've probably seen this one not less than 8 times **(probably more)** and would happily watch it again.

- **Book:** *"Rough Draft"* by Sergey Lukyanenko

    Peak fiction, enough said *(and the only way to go about this without spoilers)*.  
    This one comes from my favourite fantasy/sci-fi author - **Sergey Lukyanenko** and, putting manga aside, his are the books I've re-read the most.  
    Obviously, if I had to highlight **one**, it would definitely be - **"Rough Draft"**. Maybe because it was my introduction to his work or maybe because it really is **THAT** good, but something made this book stick with me for over a decade already.

    **P.S.** - just, whatever you do, don't watch the movie adaptation - it is absolutely horrendous.

## My Bootcamp Goals:

Ultimately, I just want to do what I **like** and be **good** at it.  

I rebooted my career this year, moving away from the industry I love to move away from a role I didn't.
I've worked in **iGaming** *(Live Games)*, for over 6 years, which is still the majority of my proffesional life and I had the pleasure of covering roles from "Game Presenter" and all the way to "Account Manager".  

I always felt drawn towards more technical aspects of my work, regardless of the role I was in at the time and this interest pushed me to do a lot of self-learning on the side (various coding courses, CS introduction and eventually QA, Test Automation and ISTQB).  

Long story short, I found something that I liked a lot, I worked hard to make it a part of my professional life and now I have the opportunity to move back into the industry I love, without moving away from the role I grew so fond of.  

I work as a QA Engineer and a QA Team Lead for LV office at the momment and automation is the next big thing I want to branch into. I already have automation courses behind my back, as well as a lot of self-learning pratice with code and I am excited for all the new things EVO bootcamp will introduce me to!
