## Favorite movie:
I don't have one specified favorite movie, but I really enjoy Christopher Nolan's movies. I love when after watching my mind is blowed and I have to think what does happen in the film for the next few days. Of course the plot have to be well thinked and has it's purpose. Nolan's movies I find great in this field.

## Skills after completing the bootcamp:
I think after completing the bootcamp I'll fluently oparate with GIT and I'll can write and perform automate tests. I'm looking forward to become an Automation QA in Evolution. It would be a desirable step in my self-development, since I'm already a QA Engineer.
