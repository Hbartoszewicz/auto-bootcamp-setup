### Name & Surname 

Ilvo Kristapsons

### Favorite book/s

Currently reading through "Malazan Book of the Fallen" series, I'm a bit of a fantasy genre nerd. This one is a bit tough and complex to get into at first but has incredible world building and has a more mature spin on fantasy genre in general.

### Skills after bootcamp

Hopefully with enough knowledge to write and maintain auto tests for video team.
