*My absolute favourite music album is "Man Alive!" by King Krule as it runs me through a complete emotional spectrum and is designed uniquely in the way of making up a seamless series of tracks.*

First of all, I will definetely have run through an entire Javascript/Overall QA Automation engineer workflow and will have got acquainted with a vast variety of tools and techniques, a vital part of any QA Automation Engineer's toolset. Work with Postman will give me a deeper understanding of the interaction process with APIs. Having used Jest (Mocha and Chai), I will get an outlook on basics of integration and unit testing in Javascript. The usage of Webdriver.io will let me get familiar with modern UI testing. Finally, configuration of Jenkins jobs and, perhaps, pipelines will be a nice refresher to that tool's capabilities.
