## Favourites

### Books       

<br>

#### The Cyberiad (StanisÅ‚aw Lem)
> Its one of the first books I remember reading, the humour and whimsical perspective on technology and futurism really stuck with me :)

<br>

#### The Hero with a Thousand Faces (Joseph Campbell)
> Fascinating disection of storytelling and mythical archetypes, really changed my idea of what "being creative" means in context of a culture

<br><br>

### Albums  

<br>

#### Driving under the influence of jams (Electric Octopus)
> Not an actual album but rather a studio recording of the band jamming for 4 hours, amazing journey from start to finish :)

<br>

#### Colossus EP (Billain)
> One of the defining albums for the genre of neurofunk, a testament to singular focus and precision of the producer as the composition and automation of audio took a better part of a decade and was interrupted by a bomb falling on the guys studio in Sarajevo. 

<br>

### Movies  

<br>

#### Victoria (2015)
> German independent film shot in one take. The completely different relation you build with the story when there is no cuts to interrupt the process is really something, the experience is more akin to a rollercoaster than a movie. 11/10 recommend

<br>

#### Paprika (2006)
> Beautiful animation, the story perfectly showcases Campbells monomyth/Jungian archetypes
