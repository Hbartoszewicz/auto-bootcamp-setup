## Favourites
I have always been a loyal fan of books by Donna Leon, an American who lives in Venice and describes the adventures of Venetian police commissioner Brunnetti. I love everything in her books-descriptions of the cuisine, stories about the doges, brilliantly conducted culinary plots. I sincerely recommend it!
