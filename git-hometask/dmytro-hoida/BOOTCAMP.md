## My favourite book is Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling.

My passion for the books about the boy who lived dates back to the days when I was a little boy.

It is a coming-of-age history that I grew older with. Everyone knows it because we all have seen the films but the books have much a deeper and richer plot.

I used to read those books relentlessly and I never had enough. The topics that appear in the story such as friendship, loyalty, redemption, good versus evil helped me mature and become a passionate reader that I am up until this very moment.

All in all, I believe it's a story that every child and every adult should read at least once.
