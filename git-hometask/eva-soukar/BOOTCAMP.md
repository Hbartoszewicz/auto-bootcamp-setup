## Name
My name is *Eva Soukar*.  

## Fvaourite book
My favourite book is a novel written by *Jane Austen*. It is called **Sense and Sensibility**. I like it because I like old English novels. These novels make me feel as a part of the past when I read them.  

## Skills after bootcamp
After the autmomation bootcamp, I expect myself to be able to write tests and to use the different frameworks and prgrams used in testing. To write commands in the Terminal without looking in cheatsheets will be great also.
