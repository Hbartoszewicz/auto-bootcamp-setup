It's an adventure novel written by French author Alexandre Dumas completed in 1844.

I re-read this novel about tragic love, countless treasures and 
cruel revenge several times and always found something new for myself.

I love this book for the depth of feelings for the experiences of Edmond Dantes, it is fascinating.
