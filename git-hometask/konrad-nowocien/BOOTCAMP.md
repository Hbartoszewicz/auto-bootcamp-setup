## Full Name

Konrad Nowocien

## Favourite book/album/movie and why

I do not have a favourite movie, however, there is an animated film I watched as a kid that brings the best memories. At that time, I still believed in Santa Claus, so I wrote a letter to him asking for just one item: Space Jam VHS - which I later found under yhe Christmas Tree, confirming that I was a good boy. 
A mix of Looney Tunes characters and one of the most recognizable athlete-Michael Jordan, made me watch it dozens of times even though I have never been a huge basketball fan.
