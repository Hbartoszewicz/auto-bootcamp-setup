## My book 
  
My favorite book is The Master and Margarita. I have read it many times and always find something new in it.  

## After bootcamp  

I think that I can get a lot during this time. Learn more about testing and automation in theory and practice. Improve my TypeScript skills. And a lot more. I also met a lot of new wonderful people. And of course I hope that as a result I will be able to become part of the Evolution team.
