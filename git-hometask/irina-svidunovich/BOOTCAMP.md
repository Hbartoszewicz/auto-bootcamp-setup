## Favourite album

My favourite album - Airline White Noise by Crafting Audio.

An exceptional collection of only five tracks that fits any atmosphere and helps to stay focused on my tasks.
While listening to this masterpiece, I can do my usual things (read, sleep, work, cry, etc.), imagining that I am on an airplane. 

Personal favourite: track â„–4 - Cabin Noise Focus.

Caution: The album will most likely ruin your Spotify Wrapped.
