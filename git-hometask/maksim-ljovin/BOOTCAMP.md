## Maksim Ljovin

Hello! My name is Maksim Ljovin

## Favorite movie

As an amateur astronomer I'm really fond of the movie "Contact", based on the Carl Sagan's book - which is also my favorite. In my opinion it's one of the best, and most accurate sci-fi films out there.

## My skills after bootcamp completion

After the bootcamp I will finally have some experience in QA, thanks to the amazing Evolution Team!
