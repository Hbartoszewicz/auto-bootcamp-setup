## My Favourite Book, Album, Film  
> *Sure, before I name my favourite book, album and film I'd like to highlight the fact that it is not easy to single out just one of each of them because the world of art is very rich and each period of my life, priorities  and mood can be charaterized by completely different books, music and films. And of course as any woman I'd like to speek about my first brighetest emotions caused by contact with them. It can be compared with "First Love"...*

> *This book is for sure the first book which brought me to tears and made me laugh all the time while I was reading it. I was a teenager and it was the first serious  two-volume novel I'd ever read. The experience exxeded all expectations. You know, that is a such strong feeling of after-taste that through many years of my life I always think that I'll never read this book again not to change my first feelings and not to be upset:)*

### **[Enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_(German_band))**

> *It's german music project or music band. I can listen to their music in any mood, at any period of my life. The music which brings you to your inner world, to real yourself, put the life on hold...*

### **[Pulp Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction)**

> *This film is a real masterpiece.The actors themselves, their play, dialogues, themes during conversations,costumes, scenery...- I can definitely say Quentin Tarantino is for sure a genium! Each time I watch this film I feel real satisfaction :)*  

# The skills...
It's very difficult to describe my skills after completing the bootcamp almost at the beginning of our education :)))But based on how the first sessions have gone I'm sure that I will become a super QA Automation specialist which Evolution needs ;))  
But seriously, I hope that the competence of lecturers and my hard work and efforts will make me a free user of different QA frameworks. I will easilly use API testing (Postman,etc.) in my job and feel free myself during writing codes for automation testing. I will be able to automate End-2-End, Regression and other types of testing. And I think these are the smallest part of skilks which I will gain during the bootcamp!
