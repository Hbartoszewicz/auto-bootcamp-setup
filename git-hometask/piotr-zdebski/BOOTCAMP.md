## Fav album:   
Iron Maiden - Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. One of the greatest metal albums from one of the greatest metal bands in the world. It represents Iron Maiden at their highest peak. The songs are unforgettable, the writing is a masterpiece and the music is a blast, so you get 44 minutes of pure perfection. What can I say more? :D
