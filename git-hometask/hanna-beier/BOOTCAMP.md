### What books and music I like
I don't really have one favorite book, but I really enjoy reading books by **John Grisham** which are mostly legal thrillers. Recently I also decided to catch up with the whole **Harry Potter** series and I enjoyed it very much. When it comes to music I really like **Rammstein** and I finally had a chance this year to fulfill my dream about going to their concert. 

### My plans connected with this bootcamp
This QA Automation Bootcamp is a great opportunity for me to gain new skills and grow professionally. I already learned a lot about Git and hope to learn much more.
After finishing this bootcamp I would like to start working as a QA engineer and start gaining some more practical experience.
