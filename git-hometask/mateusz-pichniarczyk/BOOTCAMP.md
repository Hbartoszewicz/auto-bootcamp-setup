### Favourite Music Album

One of my favourite albums is "Dynamite" by Jamiroquai.

Except the fact it has a lot of great songs I always listen to it with my familly in weekends mornings. I could say it's our familly tradition which makes this album my favourite.

### My skills after the bootcamp

After completing this bootcamp I'm going to increase following skills:
- understanding of testing pyramid, SDLC and STLC
- GIT usage
- FE integration testing
- Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) testing
- CUCUMBER and GHERKIN
- API testing
- Postman tool usage
- Webdriver.io usage
- E2E testing
- familarity with CI/CD with Jenkins
- deeper knwoledge on slot games testing and about whole gambling industry

I'm really satisfied with this bootcamp so far. I've already known some of the topics and tools that were/going to be mentioned but I'm always eager to refresh or deepen my knowledge!
