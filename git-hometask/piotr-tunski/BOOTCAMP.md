## My favourite book/album/movie

Favourite:
* Book - "The Witcher,  The last wish" + rest of series. Played "Witcher I" game almost in premiere before any hype and then I heard about the books. I simply sink into this univers. 
* Album - Don't have any favourite album, I'm fan of random music in spotify/youtube. If I find a song that I like very much, I listen to it until I get bored. For example now it's Shakira with song "She Wolf" but previously it was Disturbed and "The Sound Of Silence".
* Movie - Previously it was "Top Gun: Maverick (2022)" but I changed it to "Le Mans ’66". Both movies with a lot of action and they are simply suspenseful. Top Gun due amazing air scenes and Le Mans due to racing, engineering and old cars. 

## My skills after completing Bootcamp:
According to lecture schedule I should understand BASICS of:
* Theoretical knowledge of testing (STLC/SDLC in manual and automation area)
* Visual Studio Code with some tips and tricks that make works smoother
* Using Git (via terminal and UI)
* Integration testing on FE (how it works and help in testing)
* BDD, Gherkin and Cucumber (will see)
* API testing with Postman (will see)
* Visual regression and using Webdriver.io (will see)
* End-2-End tests (will see)
* CI/CD (Jenkins) (will see)
* Slot and game automation (will see)
* QA estimation and planning (will see)
* QA culture in Evolution (will see)

It's obvious that 26 hours is not enough to show everything but it gives some fundemantals about tools/frameworks/technology/structure of tests and it allow us (students) to improve our knowledge in automation area. It anwsers question how and where to start and what to avoid on our learning road due to usefull and practical advices from experienced evolution team members.
