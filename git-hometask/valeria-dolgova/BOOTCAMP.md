## Hello, I'm Valeria Dolgova :wave:

## Fun facts about me :fire:
- I'm a сandidate Master of Sports in High Jumping, so I enjoy spending my free time actively :runner: Like playing squash, doing fitboxing :punch:, riding a bicycle, and playing pool.
- Each year, especially before Christmas, I like watching Harry Potter movies :sparkler:
- I moved to Poland this year and now I'm learning not only English but Polish as well :books:
- Since I became a tester I began to notice inaccuracies everywhere :smiley: 
- I have a cat. Her name is Bony and I do really like to play with her…but she doesn't feel the same :smiley_cat:

## What's next...
I am super glad to be a part of the Evolution Bootcamp. No matter whether I get hired or not, this is a big step in my development as an AQA, and only forward from here :rocket:
