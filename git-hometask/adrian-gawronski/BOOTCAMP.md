My favourite movie is Interstellar because i love space and Sci-Fi movies that have time travel theme. Story is in my opinion very well written and it grasps your heart through the whole journey of main protagonist. I also really like the fact that black hole was created using a new CGI rendering software that was based on theoretical equations provided by Thorne and a group of researchers. Calculations also proved to be correct few years later when humanity was able to observe their first black hole ever.
At this point i learned how to work with git which proved to be really intuitive for me but i hope to learn few more tricks with your help along the way. I created my first ever test which actually passed so I'm not that bad of a programer as Rainers said- which would be the case if it failed :D I really hope I can learn how to work with Postman and Webdriver.io on the bootcamp because those things are new for me. There are many things I have yet to learn that will help me in the future to shorten the process of full flow test for example so I can be helpful for my future team. I'm really positive I can prove myself worthy thanks to the tuition from the whole team on the bootcamp.
