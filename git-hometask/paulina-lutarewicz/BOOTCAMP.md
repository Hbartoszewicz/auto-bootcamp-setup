#### My favourite book

My favourite book is **'Siewca wiatru'** written by **Maja Lidia Kossakowska**. It is a book in a polish fantasy series telling the story of Daimon Frey, who is Abaddon, the angel of destruction and the abbyss. I love the way the author uses well known themes such as heaven, hell and various myths and legends to create the world in her story.
