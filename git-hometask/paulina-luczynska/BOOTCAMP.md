## My favorite book- Mr. Tadeusz
It is a national epic. I love this book because shows the beauty of Polish culture and old customs. There are love themes, intrigues, and the theme of the secret hidden for years.

## My favorite album- A Night at the Opera (album Queen)

This album includes a song Bohemian Rhapsody. This song is soo different than other popular songs. Every minute of it the song takes you to a different place.

## My favorite movie- Inglourious Basterds

It shows at the same time the cruelty of war with a sense of humor, powerlessness and strength at the same moment. The story presented is ambiguous and the ending is not obvious. I love the way Tarantin portrays reality, not to be confused with any other director.
